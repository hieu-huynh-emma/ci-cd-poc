            "content": "<p>Sleep apnea is a disorder that involves the temporary stopping of breathing at intervals of at least 10 seconds during sleep.<br/><br/>It usually affects men aged between 40 and 70 years old.<br/><br/>It also commonly occurs in elderly individuals and those suffering from obesity.<br/><br/>In general, this sleep disorder can be divided into three categories:<br/><br/><strong>     • Obstructive apnea: </strong>This involves real airway obstruction.<br/><strong>     • Central apnea: </strong>In this case, the malfunctioning of the respiratory activity is due to a temporary loss of the nervous stimulus on the way to the respiratory muscles.<br/><strong>     • Mixed apnea: </strong>This last type is simply a mix of the two previous types of apnea.</p>"

For example, prolonged breathing pauses, groans, and puffs are observed in sleepers who suffer from sleep apnea.<br/><br/>The causes of sleep apnea can vary, but aggravating factors include the following:<br/><br/><strong>     •</strong>  use of sedatives,<br/><strong>     •</strong>  hypothyroidism,<br/><strong>     •</strong>  nasal obstruction,<br/><strong>     •</strong>  or the supine position during sleep.<br/><br/>The effects of sleep include difficulty falling asleep at night, excessive tiredness during the day, frequent headaches and concentration problems.</p>"
