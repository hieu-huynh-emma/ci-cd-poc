If you realize that Emma is not the right mattress for you, simply contact our customer service team (support@emma-sleep.ca or 1-833-366-2872). We will give you a refund for 100% of the purchase price. However, we do ask that you give yourself time to get used to your new mattress so we recommend testing your Emma for at least 3 - 4 weeks before sending it back.<\/p>"

The mattress industry is aimed at confusing customers with excess supply, pushy sales tactics and high prices.

If you do not enjoy it, just simply call or email us and we’ll pick it up free of charge<\/p>"

The Emma mattress is vacuum sealed in plastic and roll packed for delivery to your home. Upon receiving your new Emma mattress, carefully remove the plastic using a pair of scissors. A guideline for how to properly unwrap your Emma is provided in your package as well. Within a few minutes, your mattress will magically self-inflate and will be ready for you to sleep on.<\/p>"
