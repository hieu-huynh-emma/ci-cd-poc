        "content": "Other than personal taste, there are a number of factors to think about before selecting your mattress size. Have you considered: the dimensions of the bedroom, if you plan to share the bed with your partner or pets, the importance of open space versus sleep space to you? There are six different size descriptions below that will give you a better idea of what to order when you buy a mattress online.",

The Full measures 54 inches wide and 75 inches long (137 x 191 cm). Since the Full only measures 16 inches more than the twin in terms of width, it is not recommended for partners that need extra space or share with pets or children. Guest rooms would provide an ideal location for Full mattresses.",

The King mattress offers plenty of space for couples and room to spare for children or medium-sized pets. We recommend having a larger master bedroom to fit the king of at least 12 x 10 square feet.
