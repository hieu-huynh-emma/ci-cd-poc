The purchased product must be inflated within four weeks commencing the date of delivery in order to be eligible for return under the 365 Night Trial Policy.

<p><br></p>
<p>IX. GIFT AND OFFER CODES; REFERRAL PROGRAM </p>
<p>Emma may offer qualified consumers “gift codes” or “offer codes” through a variety of promotional activities and communications (collectively referred to as “offer codes”) that are redeemable towards a purchase on https://www.emma-sleep.ca/, while supplies last, and subject to certain merchandise exclusions or any other restrictions as may be determined and communicated by Emma in its sole discretion. Only valid offer codes provided or promoted by Emma will be honoured at checkout. Codes supplied or promoted by third parties unauthorized by Emma (including any unauthorized third-party websites) will not be considered valid. Each offer code promoted by Emma is non-transferable and valid for single use on an item (or items) of merchandise as determined by Emma. Offer codes may not be combined and may not be used in conjunction with the Emma Referral Program–customers are limited to the use of a single offer code per order. Offer codes cannot be used towards purchase of non-branded merchandise, packaging or applicable taxes. For online purchases, the code must be entered in the ‘Apply Coupon’ field at checkout. Offer codes are only valid online. Emma is not responsible for lost, stolen or corrupted codes or any unauthorized use of codes. Offer codes cannot be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent; no substitutions or credits allowed. The dollar value of any offer code will not be refunded or credited back if any or all the merchandise is returned. Expiry dates may apply to each offer code. Offer codes are void if copied, transferred, sold, exchanged or expired, and where prohibited. Requests not complying with all offer code requirements will not be honored. </p>
<p>Refer-a-friend: In order to be eligible for the Refer-A-Friend program, you have to be an Emma customer and have an Emma customer account. To refer a friend, go to your customer account, click on the “My referred friends“ tab and enter their email address. Your friend will then receive an email with their personalised voucher code. The voucher code is only valid on purchases made on emma-sleep.ca. The minimum spend is $290. The voucher code can be used on the entire Emma range and in conjunction with other offers and promotions. You are entitled to the $50 cash reward if the referred friend keeps their Emma products beyond their 365-night trial period. To receive the $50 cash reward, contact our customer service team by sending an email to support@emma-sleep.ca or calling them on 1-888-585-3662. Restrictions might apply. Conditions: We reserve the right to invalidate the voucher if it is made public on the internet or appears on any search engine. In this case the referrer also loses their claim to the $50 cash reward. The number of cash reward pay-outs is limited to ten. The voucher code becomes invalid if the referrer’s order is cancelled and the claim to the $50 cash reward is lost. The claim to the cash reward is also lost if the order is returned. The referrer and the referred cannot be the same person. People living in the same household or immediate family members cannot be referred. Customers are prohibited from using fake or multiple email addresses or customer accounts and cannot use fictitious identities to take part in the Refer-A-Friend program. We reserve the right to exclude customers from participating in this promotion, if they do not meet the necessary requirements or violate the rules in any other way. We also reserve the right to cancel the Refer-A-Friend program without further notice. For further questions about the Refer-A-Friend program please contact our customer service by sending an email to support@emma-sleep.ca or calling them on 1-888-585-3662. From time to time, Emma may also engage spokespeople, influencers, bloggers, or other individuals or entities who have been compensated or incentivized to speak on behalf of the brand. When you receive an offer code via a third-party source, such as a television or radio show host, please note that such individuals may have been compensated by Emma for their statements. </p>

<p>Informal Dispute Resolution. Both parties (You and Emma) both agree that you will try in good faith to resolve any dispute informally. If you wish to initiate this informal process, you must send a notice clearly marked “Notice of Dispute,” and have it contain a brief yet detailed written statement clarifying your name, address, and contact information, the information pertaining to your dispute, and the resolution you are seeking. All notices must be sent to support@emma-sleep.ca. We will contact you via email at the address that you have specified in your notice or at the physical address we have on file relating to any order you placed with us. Both parties (You and Emma) agree to use reasonable, good faith efforts to settle any dispute through consultation, communication, and negotiations within thirty (30) days of your submission of a formal notice. If a dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of it being formally submitted, either party may resort to the procedures described in the remainder of this section. If Emma has a dispute with you, they will follow the same procedure, except with the one caveat that they will initiate the process by sending the “Notice of Dispute” to you via email at the address specified in any such notice or the physical address we have on file relating to any order you placed with us. </p>
<p>Mandatory Arbitration. In the event that you and Emma Mattress INC are unable to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days of the “Notice of Dispute” (as described above), both parties (You and Emma Mattress, Inc.) agree to resolve the dispute through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under “Exceptions” below, and unless you have opted-out of this agreement to arbitration by following the procedure described below. </p>
<p>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate </p>
<p>You can decline this agreement to arbitrate within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Site or the date on which you purchased a Product (whichever is later) by contacting support@emma-sleep.ca in written form (including via email) clearly marked with the subject stating “Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate” that states that you decline this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If you do not choose to opt out, both parties (You and EMMA) agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of any disputes arising out of or relating to your use of the Site under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The AAA Rules and fee information are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. </p>
<p>Arbitration be held in Delaware, unless both parties (You and Emma) otherwise agree in writing. You may not, and you promise not to, initiate any legal action or proceeding against Emma (including its employees, officers, agents, advisors, and sister companies) in any other forum or location. </p>
<p>[Any dispute arising between You and Emma concerning the Terms shall be referred to and finally resolved by a single arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of the Arbitration Act (British Columbia). Any such arbitration shall be held in the City of Vancouver, British Columbia and will be conducted in the English language. The decision of the arbitrator on all issues or matters submitted to the arbitrator for resolution shall be conclusive, final and binding on all of the parties.] </p>
<p>Emma will reimburse all filing and arbitration fees for claims of less than $75,000 unless the arbitrator determines that a claim is frivolous or was brought in bad faith or for an improper purpose. You are responsible for any other costs that you may incur in connection with the arbitration, including but not limited to attorney's fees and expert witness costs, unless Emma is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. For claims that total more than $75,000, the applicable arbitration rules shall govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees. Both parties (You and Emma) agree not to seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim is frivolous or was brought in bad faith or for an improper purpose. </p>
<p>You agree that you may resolve any dispute with Emma only on an individual basis, and that you may not, to the extent permitted by law, bring any claim or demand as a plaintiff of, or otherwise participate as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative action or proceeding. Further, unless both parties (You and Emma) otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class, consolidated or representative proceeding. Therefore, you acknowledge and understand that each of the following restrictions applies to any dispute you have with Emma (including its employees, officers, agents, and advisors) arising out of or relating to your use of the Site, purchase of any Products, or these Terms: </p>
<p>If any court or arbitrator determines that the class, consolidated, or representative action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration may proceed on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, then the dispute will not be subject to arbitration and, other than small claims actions, must be brought in a federal or provincial court of competent jurisdiction in Vancouver (British Columbia). Both parties (you and Emma) irrevocably consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there and waive all objections to venue or personal jurisdiction there (except for objections based on failure of service of process). Both parties (You and Emma Mattress, Inc.) also each agree to waive our right to a jury trial in these circumstances. </p>
<p>Exceptions. Either you or Emma may bring a lawsuit for injunctive relief to prevent and/or to stop (1) unauthorized use or abuse of the Site, (2) defamation, libel, or other false or misleading statements, or (3) any actual or threatened intellectual property infringement or unfair competition without first engaging in the informal dispute resolution and arbitration processes described above. </p>
