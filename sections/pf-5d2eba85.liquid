    <p id="isPasted">The Emma Mattress Warranty </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Here at Emma, we aim to provide our customers with the best experience we can. This of course includes protecting your recent purchase for up to 10 years where the following terms and conditions apply. </p>
    <p>Emma’s 10-year warranty refers to certain issues with the dimensional stability and durability of the mattress core. Emma’s warranty covers a defective Emma mattress that is the result of production damage or faulty workmanship/materials. In addition, Emma warrants any cracks, dents, or damage to the foam which have arisen despite proper use and handling. The warranty is valid from the date you receive your new Emma mattress, and is valid for the first 10 years of use. This means, that if the issue(s) previously stated is(are) raised to Emma through our support email (support@emma-mattress.ca or 1-888-585-3662) within 10 years of the receipt of the mattress, at Emma’s discretion, the mattress will be replaced. </p>
    <p>This warranty is non-transferable to other products or consumers. Thus, solely the original purchaser of the mattress is entitled to any warranty covered by Emma. This warranty applies solely to the mattress, not including any additional accessory products purchased. This warranty is only valid for those Emma customers whom use the product for personal consumer use. If the mattress is resold to a secondary consumer by the original one, Emma is not held responsible for any damage to the product, whether through normal use or otherwise. In order to apply for a warranty claim, Emma may require that the consumer provide proof of purchase, including the date of purchase on the mattress. If proof of purchase and/or original legal tags are lost within the 10-year timeline, Emma holds no responsibility to replace said product. </p>
    <p>This warranty applies only to Emma mattresses sold within the United States. </p>
    <p>This warranty applies only to mattresses found to be defective despite normal use within the home. Specifically, the Emma mattress warranty does not cover the use of the mattress for a medical patient of any kind. </p>
    <p>To further define the terms of “damage” during “normal use or faulty production,” the Emma warranty covers indentations that are greater than 1.5 inches when compared with the surrounding mattress area that permanently do not return to their normal height after the release of pressure. Such measurements must be conducted when the mattress is on a flat surface. The cover must also be unzipped so as best to measure the indentation. In addition, any cracks that arise in the foam despite proper use and handling are covered by the warranty within the 10-year time period. It is at Emma’s discretion to determine if such damage was reasonably the result of normal use and/or production faults. </p>
    <p>The Emma mattress warranty also requires that the mattress be laid upon a flat surface during use. This is recommended on our website for optimal comfort and practicality but is required for application of warranty. </p>
    <p>Emma holds the right to ask for proof of damage along with application of warranty. This proof can include, though is not limited to photos of the damage in such a way that there is little to no reasonable doubt of the extent of the damage. The warranty shall not apply if Emma determines that the damage is the result of misuse or neglect. Thus, Emma shall reasonably make such determination if damage such as but not limited to odors, burns, cuts, infestation, or bodily fluids are present at the time of the application of warranty. </p>
    <p>If the warranty application is approved, Emma will replace the mattress, free of charge to the original purchaser. Emma will not repair the old mattress in any way. The product will be replaced with the same model (as long as that model remains in production), and no upgrades will be made/offered. Shipping of the new Emma mattress and pick-up of the damaged Emma mattress will be the responsibility of Emma and complementary to the original purchaser. </p>
    <p>The removable cover of the Emma mattress is warranted for 10 years, assuming normal use. Thus, any use deemed to be abnormal and/or neglectful will not be covered by the warranty. If the application of warranty is approved, Emma will replace the cover, free of charge to the original purchaser. </p>

Such measurements must be conducted when the pillow is on a flat surface. The cover must also be unzipped so as best to measure the indentation. In addition, any cracks that arise in the foam despite proper use and handling are covered by the warranty within the 10-year time period. It is at Emma’s discretion to determine if such damage was reasonably the result of normal use and/or production faults.<br><br>The Emma pillow warranty also requires that the pillow be laid upon a flat surface during use. This is recommended on our website for optimal comfort and practicality but is required for application of warranty.<br><br>Emma holds the right to ask for proof of damage along with application of warranty. This proof can include, though is not limited to photos of the damage in such a way that there is little to no reasonable doubt of the extent of the damage. The warranty shall not apply if Emma determines that the damage is the result of misuse or neglect. Thus, Emma shall reasonably make such determination if damage such as but not limited to odors, burns, cuts, infestation, or bodily fluids are present at the time of the application of warranty.<br><br>If the warranty application is approved, Emma will replace the pillow, free of charge to the original purchaser. Emma will not repair the old pillow in any way. The product will be replaced with the same model (as long as that model remains in production), and no upgrades will be made/offered. Shipping of the new Emma pillow and pick-up of the damaged Emma pillow will be the responsibility of Emma and complementary to the original purchaser.<br><br>The removable cover of the Emma pillow is warranted for 10 years, assuming normal use. Thus, any use deemed to be abnormal and/or neglectful will not be covered by the warranty. If the application of warranty is approved, Emma will replace the cover, free of charge to the original purchaser.</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-iUKqMP iPshnk pf-687_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmciRz hKEAti pf-689_">For Warranty Inquiries</span></h3><p class="sc-eFegNN jgBUGG pf-690_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmciRz hKEAti pf-692_">Please contact us at support@emma-sleep.ca or 1-888-585-EMMA<br><br>Emma Sleep Canada Inc.
