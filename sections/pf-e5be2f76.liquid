This means, it is not a binding offer to sell. You may submit your offer to buy via our order system integrated into our Website.
<br>4.2 When purchasing Products via the Website, the Products you intend to purchase are placed in our virtual shopping cart (‘Shopping Cart’). You can view and access your Shopping Cart at any time and on each page of the Website and you can also make changes to your existing Shopping Cart. Once you have decided to purchase a Product in your Shopping Cart, you can enter your personal details, select the method of payment and select the shipping conditions. Prior to purchase, you can check, change, or cancel the purchase in its entirety. By clicking the “Buy now” button you make an offer to buy the Products from Emma Sleep.
<br>4.3 You may return to the Website before placing your Order by clicking on the “back” button found on your internet browser, after checking your information and/or close your Internet browser to cancel the order process.
<br>4.4 Our acceptance of your Order will take place when we email you notification of our acceptance of your Order. At this point, a contract will come into existence between you and Emma Sleep.
<br>4.5 If we are unable to accept your offer, we will inform you of this and will not charge you for the Products. We may not be able to accept your order:
(a) because a Product is out of stock;
(b) because of unexpected limits in our resources which could not be reasonably planned for;
(c) because we have identified an error in the price or description of the Products; or
(d) because we are unable to meet a delivery deadline which you have specified.
<br>4.6 It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your Order so that, where the Product’s correct price at your Order date is less than our stated price at your Order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the Product’s correct price at your date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your Order. If we accept and process your Order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could reasonably have been recognized by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any goods provided to you.
<br>4.7 The rights and obligations under a Contract of Sale between Emma Sleep and You, duly concluded in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, may not be assigned or transferred to any third parties under any circumstances.

22.6 If you are not a consumer, you are entitled to resell the Products in the ordinary course of business.

The purchaser is also authorized to collect the debt. The seller reserves the right to collect the claim itself if the purchaser does not properly fulfill its payment obligations. In case of connection and mixing of the reserved Products, the seller acquires co-ownership of the new item in the ratio of the invoice value of the reserved Products to the other processed items at the time of the processing. The seller undertakes to release the collateral which is due to the seller at the buyer’s request insofar as the value of the collateral exceeds the claim to be secured by more than 10%. The choice of securities to be released is incumbent upon the seller.
