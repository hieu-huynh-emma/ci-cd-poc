This is the most common material used in the mattress industry for decades.<br><br>Polyfoam can sense your body temperature and adjust its softness accordingly. A good polyfoam mattress should have the ability to evenly distribute the pressure area and help spinal alignment.<br><br>However, there is a downside for most polyfoam material–it cannot effectively dissipate the heat.<br><br>Some people might feel hot in Summer when sleeping on it. To overcome this disadvantage, Emma invented Airgocell® foam. This innovation makes the foam super breathable. It can absorb the moisture and keep air flowing through the mattress smoothly.<sub><br></sub></span></p></div></div></div><div class="sc-faUpoM jULbDz pf-107_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-fydGpi bMfPUC pf-108_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-edERGn cHFtyQ pf-109_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hgKiOD hnskCB pf-111_">What is a memory foam mattress?</span></h3><p class="sc-iukxot iZqxsD pf-112_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hgKiOD hnskCB pf-114_">Memory foam was first used in aircraft cushions and even in hospitals to support patients that could not move easily. Eventually, it made its way to the mattress market. It allows sleepers access to a premium grade material without having to pay thousands of pounds. <br><br>Many have described the experience as having millions of tiny springs embedded in the mattress. The material can help relieve pressure and eliminates much of the vibration feedback from position-shifting bedmates.<br><br>Memory foam is made of temperature-sensitive viscoelastic material. This material allows the foam to take the shape of your body and gives the sleeper a sense of being cradled and contoured.<br><br>Many people think that memory foam mattresses can cause back pain because of the “sinking-in”. However, according to the National Sleep Foundation, mattresses made from memory foam might work better to alleviate the back pain.<br><br>The couture feature is ideal for spine alignment and maintaining posture.<br><br>Similar to all foam containing polyurethane, memory foam mattresses also tend to trap heat. It may cause the sleeper to sweat during sleep. For this reason, you might want to find a memory foam mattress with cooling technology implemented, just like Emma Original mattress.<br><br>The Emma R&amp;D team applied breathable Airgocell foam on the top of the memory foam layer, to ensure a breathable and cooling sleeping experience.<sub><br></sub></span></p></div></div></div><div class="sc-faUpoM jULbDz pf-115_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-fydGpi bMfPUC pf-116_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-edERGn cHFtyQ pf-117_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hgKiOD hnskCB pf-119_">What is a spring mattress?</span></h3><p class="sc-iukxot iZqxsD pf-120_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hgKiOD hnskCB pf-122_">There are two types of spring mattresses:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•&nbsp; pocket sprung mattress<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•&nbsp; open coil mattress<br><br>Pocket sprung mattresses are also a very popular choice among current mattress buyers.<br><br>The springs are sewn into each of the pockets within the fabric of the mattress. This offers more bounce than traditional foam mattresses. Sleepers will not sink in as much.<br><br>Reduced sinking offers sleepers the opportunity to turn more easily throughout the night. It tends to not trap as much heat as with foam mattresses. You may want to consider this option if you find yourself waking up from being too hot throughout the night.<br><br>Other types of spring mattresses include open coil and closed coil. They are usually cheaper than pocket sprung mattresses.&nbsp;<br><br>Continuous coil mattresses have springs made from a single wound wire, whereas open coil mattresses have single springs arranged by one wire.<br><br>Neither option is optimal unless you are looking for a budget mattress.<br><br>However, be cautious since the coils are fixed together this will prompt the whole mattress to move when you or your partner move during the night.
