Hot, side sleepers can select the Airgocell foam as their topmost layer and side sleepers who like a softer feel can use the soft HRX foam. Meanwhile, those needing extra head &amp; neck support are encouraged to use the visco-elastic memory foam.<\/p> \n\n<p><b>Back sleepers: <\/b>Sleepers who rest on their back require less support than a side sleeper, but more than a stomach sleeper, so we recommend using two of the Emma Foam Pillow layers. The visco-elastic foam layer is best for back sleepers who need a little more support, while the HRX foam layer is suitable for those who prefer a softer sink. Back sleepers who sleep hot can cool off and get refreshing sleep by using the Airgocell foam layer. <\/p>\n\n<p><b>Stomach sleepers: <\/b>Stomach sleepers are most comfortable sleeping with a low-loft pillow, so we recommend using only one layer of the Emma Foam Pillow. Depending on your preferences, you can use the Airgocell layer for maximum breathability, the HRX foam layer for a silky, soft feel, or the visco-elastic foam layer for optimal head and neck support. <\/p>"
